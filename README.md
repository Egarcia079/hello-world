# hello-world
This will be a short explanation of how to use github and git 

I am an Instructor working for The Knowledge House, and teaching at University Heights the Intro to Tech Program. This example is for you o see how I created this update on the README.md file, on my branch readme-edits. 

I am adding an extra line here for another example as to how branching works, and for more practice. I created a new branch called 'newBranch' and put this line. I'm going to commit this on this branch, open up a pull request on the master, and if I like the changes, then I will merge. After I merge the branch, I no longer will need this one, so I can delete it or "cut it off".
